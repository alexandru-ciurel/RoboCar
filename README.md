# RoboCar README

Greetings!

This was the first semester project that we (a group of 3 people) had to do as students in the IT Technology AP programme at the Business Academy Aarhus. It was a pretty big project consisting of multiple parts/challenges. Below, at the end, I will leave the full description of the assignment given to us by the teachers. The project was also intended to be used in a competition vs the other students and i'm proud to say that we got the first place in both challenges (fastest timing on line following and getting the boxes out). WOOHOO!

I was in charge of the programming and the devoloping of the Python code/Algorithms for our RoboCar and the code for our Web controlling interface. Of course, to see if my programming was right i also had to test it a lot in the real world conditions and to make adjustments. I will leave some videios from the testings aswell.

                        ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

          RoboCar
 
 
 Purpose of the project

• Carry out a multidisciplinary project combining several courses from the First Semester
• Build a RoboCar to meet the requirements
• Establish and work in a team
• Compete with the other RoboCars
• Present your team’s work in various forms, including a video and an oral presentation
• Write a project report
 
 Requirements for the RoboCar

The project shall be completed using only electronic hardware and the car chassis provided by the college.
Requirements: a list of items/functionality that the final product is to be able to perform
1) Line following 
Complete a line following course, marked with Black tape on standard school White Desktop as specified by the teacher
2) Remote control 
Build a web-based remote controller, which allows the robot car to be controlled by a browser interface from e.g. a smartphone, laptop, tablet or other device. As a minimum, commands to drive forwards, backwards, left and right, and to stop shall be provided. This feature shall be used in a football (soccer) competition.
3) Ultrasound challenge
The robocar will start in the middle of the arena, facing towards one of the ends of the arena. Four plastic boxes will be places in fixed spots around the arena. The actual positioning of the boxes will not be known for the competitors before the battle starts.
The challenge is for the robocar to locate and push the four boxes out of the arena in the fastest time possible.
The winner will be the robocar with the fastest time.
Each team gets two tries to set a best time.

  Requirements for the process
  
• Establish your team and make a work contract
• Plan the project, show it and control it in Trello
• Make a mid-term status Hand in see Canvas
• Keep a log or dairy

  Requirements for the delivery/hand-in
 
 • Project Report ( Not less than 48000 characters (This is rated as 20 normal pages but more than 20 pages are allowed)
    • You will be provided with guidance on the format and content of the report as part of the project process but it should include:
       • Reflections on your collaboration, your planning and implementation of the project.
       • A technical description of the full system made by the team
         • A Block Schematic
         • A Full Wiring Diagram
         • A simple Network description
            • IP-number configuration for Client and Server and Gateway
                • Network 
                • Netmask
            • Description of the RaspberryPi installation/Configuration
                • What is installed/configured (why and how)
            • Description of the software modules made
                • Purpose
                • Source-Code in appendix
            • Conclusion and lessons learned.
  
  Requirements for the delivery/hand-in, in connection with the presentation

• YouTube Video (maximum length 3 minutes)
    • This is your opportunity to “sell” your product and tell about all the great features you have built into it.
• Presentation including product demonstration (15 minutes including questions)
    • This presentation will be for the whole class and every group member should take an active part in the presentation.
    • The presentation material should be provided as an electronic presentation : .ppt, .pdf, link to Prezi or some other web-based presentation.
  
  The competitions during the project There will be 2 competitions:
 1. Practical Competition in the Basement/Cantina/Somewhere else
 Line following competition, Sumo Battle and a Football competition.
Rules for the competitions are as follows (in case of doubt, the teachers’ decisions are final and binding):
 • Line Following:
• The RoboCar shall be able to follow a line , using onboard systems and software.
• No external control is allowed in the line following competition.
• Credit will be given for the speed with which the task is completed. Hint: Completing
the course in the fastest possible time requires that the RoboCar reacts both smoothly
and quickly
• Sumo Battle 2 (autonomous contest to push all other RoboCars outside of a Sumo wrestling ring):
• No external control is allowed in the Sumo Battle 2 competition.
• The RoboCar shall use onboard sensors (ultrasonic distance sensors) to provide
control inputs.
• Remote controlled Football Game (soccer)
• The RoboCar shall be steerable via a network interface hosted on a remote computer.
• This shall be a Web-based (browser and HTTP) application.
• Make the car able to interact in a remote controlled football Game. There are a lot of
different soccer games to be found on the internet (try googling “robot soccer”). This is the first time we will try this, so the rules may not be quite set yet but
 o The football field will be 2x3 meters with sidewalls
o The cars may use a servocontrolled “kick” device.
o The goal will be 1 meter wide in each end of the lane
o There will be two halfs of each 7 minutes (A third half if the score is unsettled) o 4 robots on each team and the teams will be set on the day of the game
  NB: shall = mandatory

2. Presentations in the Class
 You will present your project, including relevant reflections, and show your YouTube video. We will end the presentations with prizes for the best:
 • T eamwork
• Report
• Presentation
• Line battle
• Sumo battle
• YouTube of the RoboCar
• Best player of the soccer match
 The activities will end with evaluation, prize giving and refreshments Provided hardware
