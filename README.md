# RoboCar README

Greetings!

This was the first semester project that we (a group of 3 people) had to do as students in the IT Technology AP programme at the Business Academy Aarhus. It was a pretty big project consisting of multiple parts/challenges. Below, at the end, I will leave the full description of the assignment given to us by the teachers. The project was also intended to be used in a competition vs the other students and i'm proud to say that we got the first place in both challenges (fastest timing on line following and getting the boxes out). WOOHOO!

I was in charge of the programming and the devoloping of the Python code/Algorithms for our RoboCar and the code for our Web controlling interface. Of course, to see if my programming was right i also had to test it a lot in the real world conditions and to make adjustments. I will leave some videios from the testings aswell.
